ROS-based Multi-Model Classification using Python and scikit-learn

ROS-Based Multi-Model Classification Project
ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project demonstrates a series of machine learning classification tasks using Python (scikit-learn) within the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework. Multiple datasets including Fruit, Iris, Breast Cancer, and Penguin are used. The classifiers implemented include Linear Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Visualizations and performance metrics are also included

---------------------------------

ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- ROS Noetic
- Jupyter & Ubuntu Linux

----------------------------------

ðŸ§­ Workflow Overview
Each classification task follows this pipeline:
1. Dataset Import and Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering and Label Encoding
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training
5. Prediction and Evaluation
6. Visualization and Reporting
